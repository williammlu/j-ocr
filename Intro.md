Pure Java Based optical Character Recognition Software.

# Introduction #



This is a Optical Character Recognition software completely written in Java. Here we do not use predefined font database.

The idea is very simple. With this tool one can create a knowledge repository specific to the requirement at hand, there by having to keep the only the fonts that are required.

The method to create the fonts are very simple. The process of recognition is fast. Here we do not use any artificial intelligence concepts. All we do is a pixel by pixel comparison against the created knowledge. Very simple and fast.

Its also language independent.
